How To Contribute
=================

This site is build with Sphinx ( https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html ) and ReStructured Text

You can contribute in several ways!

* Ask! If you post a message asking for something to be added / changed / removed, just post a message in the Sierra ILS Slack, and someone will help!
* Do it yourself!

Modifying / Adding to the ils-undergound-docs Site
--------------------------------------------------

If you're interested in the DIY-route, here's a rough set of steps you can use:

1) Sync the ``ils-underground-docs`` repo, move into the ils-underground-docs directory, `and then` clone ``ils-undergound.github.io`` repo to the build/html target

   .. code-block:: bash
   
       git clone git@github.com:ils-underground/ils-underground-docs.git
       # NOTE: you may want to add this instead if you're not using ssh (but you should just use ssh if you can):
       # https://github.com/ils-underground/ils-underground-docs.git
       # Cloning into 'ils-underground-docs'...

       cd ils-underground-docs
       
       git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:ils-underground/ils-underground.github.io.git build/html
       # NOTE: you may want to add this instead if you're not using ssh (but you should just use ssh if you can):
       # https://github.com/ils-underground/ils-underground.github.io.git build/html
       # Cloning into 'build/html'...    

2) Create the python environment (using ``venv``) for the build software (Sphinx)

   .. code-block:: bash

      python3 -m venv venv

3) Activate the virtual environment and install the required python modules and software
   
   .. code-block:: bash

      source venv/bin/activate
      # you should have (venv) before your prompt now
      pip install -U pip
      # ...
      pip install -r requirements.txt

4) Make any changes or add additional files to the site (just as an example, write some test text to add a test page)

   .. code-block:: bash

      # this is purely here just for a simple example ... 
      echo $'TEST\n====' > source/test.rst

5) run the script to create the static files (this will create the ``build`` directory, which should now contain the static site in the ``html`` directory)

   .. code-block:: bash

      # make sure you still have the (venv) prompt or have the virtual environnement active
      make html

6) Assuming you're still in the root of the ``ils-underground-docs`` directory, move into the ``build/html`` directory, add the files to staging, and then commit

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      cd build/html
      git add .
      git commit -m 'my super-helpful commit comment here!'
      git push origin main
